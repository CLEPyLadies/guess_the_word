# The first step is to import the python libraries that will help us.
# This is done for you here

import random

# Next we will declare the variable that holds the number of guesses or
# chances that our player has to correctly guess the word
# Put your code in the spaces between comments

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# We need a list of words five letters long that our game will select
# from.  Declare the list here.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Now we will be using a function from the library we imported.  
# This is the random.choice() function which chooses a word at random
# from our list.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Next, letâ€™s make a list using the list() function. This will be the
# clue that tells our player how many letters are in the word.  We will
# use a string of question marks for our clue.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Next, select a symbol from https://emojipedia.org/ and declare a variable
# with that symbol.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Now we need to create an indicator that the word has been guessed #correctly.
# We want the staring value to be False.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Here we will declare the function that updates the clue.
# ============START CODING==============






# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Here we will write the function that takes the a list and concatenates it into a string with the guessed letters.
# ============START CODING==============


    
# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Now we start building the game play code.
# Write a print statement that opens the game.
# ============START CODING==============

# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Here, put a while loop that
#   a) prints the guesses,
#   b) states how many guesses are left, and
#   c) allows the person to guess a letter or word.
# Also, add in an if/else block that updates the clue and the
# number of guesses left in the game
# ============START CODING==============














# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Outside of the loop (aka unindented), set up the ending of the game.
# Make sure to include both the win condition and the loss condition.
# ============START CODING==============




# ============PAUSE CODING==============
# Done! Whether you won or lost, you learned! <3
