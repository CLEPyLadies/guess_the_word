#The first step is to import the python libraries that will help us.
#This is done for you here
   
import random

#Next we will declare the variable that holds the number of guesses or #chances that our player has to correctly guess the word

#put you code in the spaces between comments

#We need a list of words five letters long that our game will select #from.  Declare the list here.

#Now we will be using a function from the library we imported.  
#This is the random.choice() function which chooses a word at random #from our list.

#Next, letâ€™s make a list using the list() function. This will be the #clue that tells our player how many letters are in the word.  We will #use a string of question marks for our clue.

#Next, select a symbol from https://emojipedia.org/ and declare a variable #with that symbol.    



#Now we need to create an indicator that the word has been guessed #correctly. We want the default to be False.






#Here we will declare the function that updates the clue.






#Here we will write the function that takes the a list and concatenates it into a string with the guessed letters.





    
#Now we start building the main text of the game.
#Write a print statement that opens the game.





#Here, put a while loop that a) prints the guesses, b) states how many #guesses are left, and c) allows the person to guess a letter or word.
#Also, add in a if/else statement that updates the clue and guesses
#left in the game
    





    
#Outside the loop, set up the ending the game, for both the win  #condition and the lose condition.
